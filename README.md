Background:
The school board has notified the team that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School (THS) ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to the team for help. The team has been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once  the math and reading scores have been relpaced, we can then repeat the school district analysis done earlier and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

Work Being done:
Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
